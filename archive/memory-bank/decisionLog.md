# Decision Log

This document records key implementation decisions made during the development of the Jezweb Hub dashboard.

## Architectural Decisions

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Alternatives Considered | Impact |
|------|----------|-----------|------------------------|--------|
| 12/03/2025 | Use TailAdmin Pro template as starting point | Provides a well-designed UI framework with components that match the requirements | Building from scratch, using other templates | Faster development, consistent design |
| 12/03/2025 | Use Firebase for backend | Provides authentication, database, storage, and hosting in one platform | Custom backend, other BaaS solutions | Simplified backend development, integrated services |
| 12/03/2025 | Modular architecture | Allows for easier maintenance and extension of functionality | Monolithic architecture | Better code organization, easier to extend |
| 12/03/2025 | Use TypeScript | Provides type safety and better developer experience | JavaScript | Fewer runtime errors, better IDE support |
| 12/03/2025 | Use Vite as build tool | Faster development experience, better performance | Webpack, Create React App | Improved developer experience, faster builds |
| 12/03/2025 | Create dedicated services for Firebase operations | Encapsulate Firebase logic in service modules for better separation of concerns | Direct Firebase calls in components | Improved maintainability, testability, and reusability |

## Implementation Decisions

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Alternatives Considered | Impact |
|------|----------|-----------|------------------------|--------|
| 12/03/2025 | Create reusable Firebase service modules | Encapsulate Firebase logic in service modules | Direct Firebase calls in components | Better separation of concerns, easier testing |
| 12/03/2025 | Use context API for state management | Simpler than Redux for this application size | Redux, MobX | Reduced boilerplate, easier to understand |
| 12/03/2025 | Create shared UI components | Ensure consistent UI across the application | Component duplication | Reduced code duplication, consistent UI |
| 12/03/2025 | Implement EN-AU spelling | Match client requirements | EN-US spelling | Consistent with client expectations |
| 12/03/2025 | Create detailed implementation plan for Organisations | Provide clear structure for implementing the Organisations functionality | Ad-hoc implementation | Better organization, clearer development path, easier to track progress |
| 12/03/2025 | Implement Settings service for dropdown options | Centralize management of dropdown options in a dedicated service | Hardcoded options, separate services for each option type | Improved maintainability, consistent approach to settings management |
| 12/03/2025 | Use multi-step form for Add Organisation | Improve user experience by breaking down the form into logical sections | Single long form | Better UX, reduced cognitive load, clearer form structure |

## Technical Debt

| Date | Item | Description | Priority | Plan to Address |
|------|------|-------------|----------|----------------|
| 12/03/2025 | Initial setup | Using placeholder content initially | Medium | Replace with real data integration in future phases |
| 12/03/2025 | Demo data | Using generated demo data for development and testing | Medium | Replace with real data integration when available |
